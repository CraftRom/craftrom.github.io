Welcome to CraftRom!
Not everyone has this day - a holiday.  In addition, in this difficult period for my country - Ukraine, Russian invaders continue to destroy cities, take lives.  But despite this, many people decided to celebrate Easter day.  
I, as the creator of this project and a citizen of Ukraine, first of all want to congratulate ZSU and all those who protect me, my family and all Ukrainians, Poles, French, Germans and other European countries from the horde of orcs.  You are HEROES!!!  I wish you the strength and means for the destruction of pig dogs. 
For the whole world, except for the Russian, I wish peace, love and understanding of each other.
And finally, I thought for a long time to write this to the orcs, rashists, Russians.
I wish you, bitches, death to all, to live in fear, in poverty you are unworthy of another!!!

Glory to Ukraine! Glory to heroes!
Слава Україні! Героям слава!

*Yours Dmytro Galitsky*
